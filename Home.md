# Babushka
Babushka is a Redis client. Itâ€™s free, open-sourced under a permissive license (Apache 2.0), sponsored by AWS and connects to any Redis datastore. Over the years, AWS has gained operational experience in managing ElastiCache for Redis and MemoryDB at a very large scale. We know that the client library is key for reliability, performance, and security. We brought this operational experience to Babushka, and we optimized it for open-source and managed Redis workloads running on AWS. Here are some examples: Babushka is configured by default with an exponential backoff retry strategy to prevent connection storms. To handle cluster topology changes better, Babushka proactively checks DNS endpoints validity, and auto-triggers DNS refreshes. Customers do not experience slowness originating from bad connections configuration, because Babushka uses a smart connection multiplexing algorithm. Babushka is built with a common core layer, written in Rust, which can be extended to support various programming languages. With this release, Babushka supports Java, Python and JavaScript. Having a common core ensures consistency across all supported languages, and provides a unified client experience, which means similar behavior and functionality.
